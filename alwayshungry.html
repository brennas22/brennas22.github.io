            <p class="wwwww down">Why</p>

            <p>
              This project took the research and program from Dr. David Ludwig's groundbreaking book <a href="https://www.drdavidludwig.com/">Always Hungry?</a> and converted it into an app to help participants track their behavior and progress. Dr. David Ludwig and chef Dawn Ludwig were chosen as part of Boston Children's Hospital's Innovation & Digital Health Accelerator program.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Always Hungry?, Dr. David Ludwig explains why traditional diets fail, and provides a new way of eating to help people lose weight without hunger, improve their health, and feel great overall. In the accompanying cookbook, Always Delicious, chef Dawn Ludwig provides dozens of recipes that fit into the Always Hungry? way of eating as well as templates for creating your own meals.
