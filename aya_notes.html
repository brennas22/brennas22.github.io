				<h3>Wearable Husky Card</h3>
				<p>Non proctored swipe only entry is in the library (but ought to be extended into the dining halls)</p>
				<p>The Husky ID system works with RFID systems, and there are three types of RFID wristbands available: fabric with a hard plastic chip inside, vinyl wristbands with an RFID microchip, a rubber wristband with an RFID chip</p>
				<h3>Issues:</h3>
				<p>The concept of wristbands seems useless if one can only use it to gain access to one place (the library), so the best way to make them worthwhile would be to expand the non proctored swiping stations. </p>
				<p>Maybe have the RFID reader work at printing stations too?</p>
				<p>They would need some level of customization, especially to appeal to a student base who wants something that is aesthetically pleasing.</p>
				<p>This can also be extended to an app version for anyone with smart watches</p>
				<p>Using the same technology as Android/Apple Pay contact readers??</p>
