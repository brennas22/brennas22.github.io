            <p>
              The Innovation and Digital Health Accelerator @ Boston Children's Hospital wanted to tackle the issues patients, families, and caregivers encounter while physically in the hospital. We started with a broad question of what facets of onsite care could be improved and used design thinking to tackle the problems we identified.

               <h5 class="down">Storyboarding</h5>

              <p>At our next session each team member took ideas that appealed to them and wrote a high tech and a low tech scenario in the voice of our patient, Adam. Below are mine.</p>


              <div class="row stats">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                  <div class="card">
                    <h3>Low Tech Scenario</h3>
                    <p>I wake up early, and thankfully I have some time to myself in the morning. I’m worried about my upcoming CT, because my team said there’s a chance I’ll need follow up surgery. There’s a whiteboard in my room that says “CT scan 9/18” on it; I write on it “I’m nervous about this” and “how does a CT work?”  When my nurse comes in she seems my questions (which is good, because by that time I had completely forgotten because I was absorbed in a movie) and not only does she tell me the answers, she writes them on the board right under my questions so I won’t forget. She also writes me a list of steps that will happen before the CT, so I can be prepared. Then she asked me to come up to the board and together we come up with some good strategies for staying calm in the CT machine. Now I can always refer back to the board and understand my care plan that we built together.</p>

                    <h3>High Tech Scenario</h3>
                    <p>When I arrive at the hospital I get to choose a character to accompany me in my journey. I choose Charlie the Cheetah because I want to get out of here as fast as possible. Charlie becomes my companion along my journey; he has insider tips about the hospital, can get in touch with my friends and family, and helps me prepare for stuff that happens in the hospital (like scans and blood tests). Charlie also lets me tell him how I’m feeling and keeps track of my goals for my stay. I can either interact with Charlie on my iPad, or by speaking out-loud to the TV. When a new event comes up, Charlie will hop over to it and give me the details. Once I complete the task, Charlie and I earn a badge together, which sometimes comes with extra cool bonuses like a new hat for Charlie in the game. When I leave the hospital I get a book that has pictures of things Charlie and I did, as well as some of our important conversations and my goals. There’s also advice from Charlie about going home and I get to keep a little sticker of him, which I put on my new school folder.</p>

              <h3 class="lobster down">Idea Refinement</h3>

              <p>We started to explore what an ideal state would look like for the concept we chose to pursue: helping patients get to know their care team through the use of cards (an idea spawned from collectible baseball cards) and augmented reality.</p>

              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6 col-xl-4">
                  <p class="down-large">
                    We wanted to create a design that would be interactive and allow the patient to be in control of the information they see. We wanted to provide opportunities for the patient to meet their team, learn about events in the hospital, and keep track of their schedule.
                  </p>
                  <p>I did a series of drawings to bring the concept to life and imagine how it might function.</p>

              <h3 class="lobster down">Evaluation</h3>

              <p>As we investigated this concept, I raised some concerns about how realistic it would be to implement.</p>

                  <h3>Care Team Behavior</h3>
                  <p>A major challenge we encounter at the hospital is that care team members - especially nurses - are constantly asked to integrate new and disparate technologies into their work flow. This solution woul require a lot of buy in.</p>

                </div>

              </div>

              <p class="down">Given that, we decided to significantly scale back the design and focus on creating an MVP that could be quickly implemented and tested.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, this project was derailed with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020. The pandemic fundamentally changed how our onsite units function for the foreseeable future, so the project has been put on hold.</p>

              <p>This project allowed me to facilitate a large scale design session for the first time. I was also able to see a project from the very begining stages through (part of) an MVP. I learned a lot about standing up for my ideas, especially when team dynamics are somewhat strained, and I gained comfort interviewing users and presenting my ideas.</p>
