		 		<h2>Clip</h2>
		 		<h4 class="thin">In Interaction Design I we were tasked with creating an interface for desktop and mobile that helped a user keep track of some sort of data. A problem that struck very close to home for me because of being a transfer student was the college search process. This is a big problem for thousands of teens who have a number of desires for prospective schools. While there are many websites that allow students to search by criteria, there isn't a way to save information from various sources all in one place; a student is considering not only the raw stats of the school, but also news, pictures and student testimonials all of which are found in many places on the web.</h4>

		 			this video is a walkthrough of the desktop version of Clip.

		 		<h2>Features</h2>
		 		<h4 class="thin">Clip allows users to filter schools based on a number of criteria. Once they've found a school they're potentially interested in they can create a collection centered around that school. Then, a plug in (both mobile and desktop) allows them to save
		 		external content to the school's collection, which they can then go back into Clip and organize however they choose.<br>
		 		<br>
		 		The mobile version of clip does not allow users to update their criteria due to a very complicated inputs and small amounts of
		 		screen real estate, but the user can view their predetermined choices as well as see school matches, make and edit collections
		 		and perhaps most importantly for mobile, add external items.<br><br>
		 		Recent trends in web technology have shown a large uptick and continued growth in the number of mobile users, especially when
		 		it comes to browsing content. The mobile version of Clip makes it extremely easy for users to save any content they come across
		 		directly to the relevant collection, where they can then view it on desktop as well.
		 		<br>
		 		<br>
		 			this video is a walkthrough of the mobile version of Clip.

		 		<h3>User Personas</h3>
		 		<h4 class="thin">The very first step in this project was, of course, identifying the user. As an exercise to begin thinking
		 		about user, their needs, and what data they might need to keep track of I created 3 user personas. <br>
		 		<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Persona 1: </strong>Attorney<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Fictional Name:</strong> Jane Smith <br> 
		 		<strong class="semi">Major Responsibilities:</strong> Works with disabled children and their families on IEPs and negotiations with schools<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Goals and Tasks:</strong> Keep track of client information Spends time researching policy in past cases, contacting and conversing with parents, schools, and other attorneys. <br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Environment:</strong> Decently comfortable using the basic features of a computer and cell phone, but not beyond that. Works from home, mainly via Skype and email. Is responsive to emails, but struggles when technical issues arise.<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Things they might track: </strong>payments, client information (address, phone number etc.), case status
		 		</h4>

		 		<div class="spacing"></div>
		 		<h4 class="thin"> 
		 		<strong class="semi">Persona 2: </strong>Art Student<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Fictional Name:</strong> Krya Elliot <br> 
		 		<strong class="semi">Major Responsibilities:</strong> Studying fine art: interested in painting, drawing, photography, fashion, and printmaking
		 		<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Goals and Tasks:</strong> Research for projects, look for inspiration, post to her blog, shop for supplies, listen to music <br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Environment:</strong> Extremely comfortable with computers and most modern technologies. Is away at school running on slower wifi. Spends large chunks of time away from a computer working on art, but is always on her cell phone<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Things they might track: </strong>inspirational posts, viewership on her blog, trending music
		 		</h4>

		 		<div class="spacing"></div>
		 		<h4 class="thin"> 
		 		<strong class="semi">Persona 3: </strong>High school senior<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Fictional Name:</strong> KT Brady <br> 
		 		<strong class="semi">Major Responsibilities:</strong> High school student applying to college, works as a lifeguard in the summer
		 		<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Goals and Tasks:</strong> Look at colleges, talk to friends on facebook, count instagram likes<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Environment:</strong> Extremely comfortable with all modern technologies and is up to date on current trends. Is always connected to her cell phone and responds in under 5 minutes<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Things they might track: </strong>inspirational posts, viewership on her blog, trending music
		 		</h4>

		 		<div class="spacing"></div>
		 		<h4 class="thin"> 
		 			Doing these personas made me consider the wide variety of data that people from all different walks of life are likely
		 			to be tracking. I was very drawn to the third persona of a high school student looking for the right college
		 			due to my own experience as a transfer student. I wish that I had more organized information available to me during my
		 			college search process both times. It occured to me that this issue affects not only high school seniors and transfers, 
		 			but also potentially students applying to graduate school or PhD programs as well. I did sketches for a search and information
		 			organization engine for both schools and job searches because while the criteria are different, the methodology is similar.

		 		<h3>Sketches</h3>
		 		<h4 class="thin">I began my process of identifying and soliving a problem by examining existing products. My initial
		 		idea was a job search board that would allow you to store documents etc.. I was inspired by a combination of the job
		 		search engine Monster.com and social media site Pinterest.com. I then began to tweak and expand my idea of storing imporant information
		 		on a variety of boards.</h4>

		 		<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
		 		<h4 class="thin">This project was the first that I completed end to end, from problem identification all the way through a
		 		complete design. I learned a lot about interacting with users and the design thinking process as well as some technical skills such as Balsamiq, Adobe XD, InVision and user testing. I was also able to strengthen preexisting skills such as sketching and taking feedback in order to effectively iterate. If I were to change an aspect of my process or final product I would do more extensive user testing after my first round of visual design because I made a significant number of organizational changes.</h4>
