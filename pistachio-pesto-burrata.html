        <!-- introduction -->
        <h2 class="d-block d-sm-none">Pistachio Pesto & Burrata Sandwich</h2>
        <h3>Make the pesto</h3>
        <p>Put a large pot of water to a boil on the stove.</p>
        <p>While you're waiting for the water to boil, remove the stems from the kale and roughly chop it, if you haven't done so already. Continue with the next step before the water is boiling.</p>
        <p>Peel the garlic cloves and put them into the food processor or blender with the pistachios and a healthy pinch of salt. Pulse a few times until you have a sandy paste. (Note: don't just let it run, you don't want to make pistachio butter.)</p>
        <p>When the water is boiling, get your colander ready in the sink. Drop the kale in and make sure it is submerged. Allow it to boil for ~1 minute. Or until it has turned super bright green.</p>
        <p>After a minute or so, drain the kale into the colander. Run cold water over the kale to stop the cooking and cool it down and then wring out as much water as possible from the kale. (Note: There will be a lot more than you think and also it will still be hot inside so be careful! You can use a dish towel if you don't care about it being stained green, or a bunch of paper towels, but that's not super eco-friendly and they fall apart pretty fast; just use your hands.)</p>
        <p>Add the kale to the food processor and let it run for a bit to break down the kale.</p>
        <p>Stream in olive oil until it stops resembling chimichurri and starts looking like a cohesive pesto. It takes a lot more oil than you think, but go slow, you can always add more later.</p>
        <p>Stop and taste! At this point it will probably be extremely green in flavor, like licking the grass outside a barn. Add more salt (no, more than that), a few cracks of black pepper, and your parmesan cheese. (Note: you can either add parm in chunks if you're food processor/blender can handle it, or grate it in).</p>
        <p>At this point, you have in fact made pesto, and the trick is getting the balance of flavors right. 9 times out of 10 when I'm making pesto, if it doesn't taste good yet - particularly if it still tastes like a farm - it needs more salt. Don't forget that parmesan cheese is also very salty, so you can choose which way to add the necessary saltiness.</p>
        <p>Continue adjusting the oil, salt, pepper, and parmesan until it tastes good to you - around the time you find yourself dipping the spoon more than once is when you're probably good.</p>
        <p>You can store the pesto in the fridge for... honestly it's never gone bad for me. Maybe a few weeks to be safe? You can also freeze it in a tub or in an ice cube tray.</p>
        <h3>Assemble the sandwich</h3>
        <p>Obtain 2 pieces of sourdough bread, either by slicing them off a loaf you bought or made, or pulling them, pre-sliced, out of a bag.</p>
        <p>Pop your slices of bread in the toaster. This sandwich isn't grilled or pressed, so any warmth comes from the toasting.</p>
        <p>Spread each side with a copious amount of pesto. Place blobs of burrata on one side of the bread, and slice them open with the tip of a sharp knife. Use the knife to spread the burrata over the bread. Drizzle EVOO over the burrata, sprinkle with the chopped pistachios and flaky salt, and then close your sandwich.</p>
        <p>Eat.</p>

        <h3>A bit of writing</h3>
        <p>PSA this writing is my space to practice! Whatever is written below might not be finished, it might not be edited, it might not be good. This blog is for me, not you.</p>
        <p class="">I have never lived a day in my life without pesto in my fridge. Despite my mom's intense dislike of it (how, you ask, can someone dislike a concoction that is literally just basil, oil, garlic, and cheese? I do not know.) my dad always kept some hidden in the fridge, tucked in behind the mustard, a small enough jar that it could hide behind the walls of the shelving of the refrigerator door. He'd slather it on sandwiches, toss it over pasta, or just sneak a spoonful as a semi-questionable snack - all habits I inherited.</p>
