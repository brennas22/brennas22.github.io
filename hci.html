				<p>Feedback
					<ol>
						<li>The "me" screen when nothing is assigned lacks any instructions, which makes it unclear what I am supposed to do. This seems to be <strong>visibility of system standards</strong> (Neilsen Heuristic) issue, where as the user I am unclear about how to proceed to the next step/state. This could also be considered an issue of <strong>help and documentation</strong> (Neilsen Heuristic)</li>
						<li>There is a <strong>consistency and standards</strong> (Neilsen) issue with the add button, which appears to be just a small green dot. I did not know I was supposed to click on it, until I did so out of curiosity.</li>
						<li>After I added a task, I wasn't given the option to assign it, which I was expecting. Then, when I clicked "none," it was automatically assigned to "TR" and there doesn't seem to be any way to change this. To me, this is an issue of <strong>user control and freedom</strong> (Neilsen) because I was unsure of what my actions would do, and then there was no way to undo an action I accidentally took. I was not able to assign a task to Julia Semeraro, or even to myself (unless I am TR?)</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>Good
					<ol>
						<li>Very clean and simple UI! I really like that you didn't include too much information on the screen, keeping the main goal of the application as the center focus</li>
						<li>Organization of Information is really clear. The two column system used makes it very easy to process the infromation. Even without headers, it's very clear what each column represents</li>
						<li>Simple navigation. I appreciate the use of a tab design as the top navigation - it eliminates a step (i.e. opening a hamburger menu) and makes it clear what the options are</li>

				<div class="spacing"></div>
				<img class="img-responsive" alt="Initial navigation flows" src="is4300/study.png">
				<p>There are tons of study apps available on your phone, but the major flaw is that you're still near your phone, which is a huge downside. A voice assistant could solve this problem by letting you put your phone in another room. Turn Google Home into a study buddy that can help keep you on track, study most efficiently, and make sure you focus on aspects you’re struggling with. With this Action, Google can tell you when to take breaks (and walk you through 5 minutes or meditation or a minute of stretching or jumping jacks) and play “brain-power” music to keep you focused. It can also set timers and tell you when its time to switch subjects, ideally knowing your schedule and assignments to help you prioritize what to work on when. Google can help you study by quizzing you, especially on stuff you’re struggling with; say you’re struggling for the GRE and you keep forgetting the definition of “austere”. If you tell Google what you’re struggling with it’ll make a note and quiz you again later. I’d like to explore the possibility of integrating notes, but i’m not sure the feasibility. </p>

				<h4 class="center"><strong>Idea 2: Vault</strong></h4>
				<div class="spacing"></div>
				<img class="img-responsive" alt="Initial navigation flows" src="is4300/vault.png">
				<p>Vault is the perfect place to store mementos from friendships and relationships. When you talk to someone constantly there’s too much information to sift through if you want to find a special message or picture, but there’s often stuff one might want to keep track of. Using Vault, you can save special memories (pictures, messages, etc) and decide who has access. Vault will allow you to organize your memories by tags, dates, or random and even give you flashbacks to memories you haven’t looked at in a while, or that occurred a significant milestone ago (i.e. 1 year). Vault is a place you can go to celebrate your friendship or relationship and keep track of what’s most important, amongst years of interactions</p>

				<h4 class="center"><strong>Idea 3: Google Home Action - UHCS Intake</strong></h4>
				<div class="spacing"></div>
				<img class="img-responsive" alt="Initial navigation flows" src="is4300/uhcs.png">
				<p>A Google Home could be placed in each exam room at UHCS and used for time-saving intake while there aren’t doctors/nurses available. The Action could be used to complete intake forms, such as the mental health questionnaire, as well as saving time by collecting basic information like why the patient came in. That information could then be transmitted to the patient record and to the doctor, minimizing the time it takes to convey basic information. There are HIPAA concerns with this project, but we would use fake data to ensure confidentiality.</p>
