            <p class="down">TLDR; Drizly wanted to prioritize gift sending as a top use case for the platform, as a way to move away from 60-minute-or-less delivery, but the existing experience created a lot of friction and did not surprise or delight customers because it was not differentiated from the core on-demand experience.</p>

            <p>As the product designer leading the charge to revamp our gifting experience, I worked with analytics and UX research to define the problem our users were facing, generated potential solutions and evaluated them against the needs of the business by collaborating with product, settled on a recommendation for the designs, and coordinated with engineering to bring it to life.</p>

            <h3 class="lobster down">Business Context</h3>
            <p>Going into 2022 & following the acquisition by Uber, Drizly decided to shift focus away from purely an on-demand, need-it-now, consumer and instead prioritize "non-core" modes of shopping, of which gifting was the top priority.</p>

             <div class="row stats ">

                  <p class="">Historically, gifting represented 20% of orders in December and 10% during the rest of the year. Drizly leadership set a goal of growing that percentage to 30% or higher, making it a key pillar of the business.</p>

            <p>"We use the words "non-core" to focus on how we make it obvious in everything we do that Drizly is about more than the convenience of delivery.  This is THE challenge; building Drizly to be the preferred destination for shopping the unique category that is alcohol. We have to think big and take some big product, ops, and marketing swings in this pursuit:  our branding, our copy, our creative, our level of customer support, in which retailers Drizly will work with and service levels we'll now tolerate, and most importantly, in what our product demonstrates to consumers.  We cannot afford to get 2% better across everything we do if we're to be successful -- we need to pick 1-2 product directions and get 5x better."</p>

            <p class="">Digging into the data illuminated some clear issues with the gifting experience. It's particularly interesting to note that a high proportion of gift senders are first time Drizly shoppers, which means they have no familiarity with the site to begin with, making the shopping experience even more confusing when they're looking for a gift and not finding any tailored affordances.</p>

            <p class="">I mapped out the existing flow for users marking their order as a gift in checkout, showing the pain points where users are directed away from checkout and forced to go backwards to enter recipient information before proceeding. In cases where they have to change the address, they may be forced all the way back to cart. We also found evidence that people may know their friends' or families' phone numbers, but not their email addresses.</p>

            <p class="down">A huge part of my role in this work was helping to <span class="highlight">prioritize the different opportunity areas</span>  from the user experience perspective. While the discovery part of the experience is delightful, and helping people find the right gifts is definitely useful, ultimately if the user can't successfully checkout and execute their gift purchase, none of the discovery portion matters. Based on that and conversations with the product team, we decided to prioritize the functional pieces of the experience before adding exploratory features.</p>

            <p class="">Dovetailing off the <a href="streamlined-checkout.html">streamlined checkout</a> work, I wanted to simplify the gift sending process into 1 single step users could easily understand. I organized the info into recipient info, sender info, and order execution. We also added the <a href="occasion-cards.html">digital occasion card selection,</a> and removed the option for surprise gifts. Lastly, email address was made optional.

            <p>Initially I thought about separating the gifting info from the checkout step, making it an interstitial space between cart and placing the order. The idea was to avoid confusion between the recipient info and the sender info and make the review step truly just "review," with no actions needed.</p>

            <p>
              Ultimately this version felt convoluted when the user needed to make any edits to their selections, where on iOS it was more natural to go backwards, on web it felt clunky and disjointed. User research also showed that people were frustrated with the number of discrete steps, so I made the choice to integrate all the info into one page, organized by type of information.

            <p class="down">We immediately saw people begin to use the digital cards in the new sender flow. Every single card has been selected (beer the least often, as it's hardly ever gifted, fun fact) and sentiment analysis of the gift messages indicate people are choosing the "correct" matching card for their occasion. We also saw a reduction in void rate when we removed surprise gifts. We did not directly A/B test the changes to the sender flow, but the performance of the cards seems to indicate it's being well utilized.</p>



            <h3 class="lobster down-large">Next steps</h3>
           <p>Now that we've simplified the functional checkout experience for gift senders, we are embarking on improving the entire funnel.</p>
