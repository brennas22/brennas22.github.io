        <!-- introduction -->
        <h3 class="lobster">Hello again.</h3>
        <p>Here's the basics: my name is Brenna, my pronouns are she/hers, and I'm a designer! I grew up in the Boston area and now live in Central Square with two roommates and my cat, Atticus. I love to cook and read, and my favorite snack is dates with peanut butter. I believe that a hot dog is not a sandwich.</a></p>

        <h3 class="lobster">Relevant information.</h3>

        <p>I graduated magna cum laude from Northeastern University in Boston, MA in 2019 with a degree in integrated software and interaction design (it was an independent major, hence the longer name). My courses were a combination of design, computer science, and healthcare related electives, due to my strong interest in accessibility. I graduated with University Honors Program Distinction, Honors in the College of Arts, Media, and Design, and as a member of <a href="https://alumni.northeastern.edu/for-students/huntington-100/">Northeastern's Huntington 100.</a></p>

        <!-- <p>I began my career as an Experience Designer at Boston Children's Hospital's Innovation and Digital Health Acclerator. I collaborated on the design of products developed in the hospital that are  spun out as consumer tools, as well as on internal solutions for the hospital's digital strategy.</p> -->

        <p>I have experience in strategy and design research as well as pixel pushing and front end development (I built this website!). I also have worked on copy writing, email marketing, and Shopify (both site design and running business operations on the platform). I have expertise in accessibility and a passion for integrating it as a consideration throughout the design process. This website complies with all ADA 508 standards for contrast and is keyboard & screenreader navigable.</p>  

        <p>I'm currently designing at the <a href="https://accelerator.childrenshospital.org/">Innovation & Digital Health Accelerator at Boston Children's Hospital.</a></p>

        <h3 class="lobster">Irrelevant information.</h3>
        <p>Outside of work, I spend a lot of time cooking and baking and purchasing too many condiments that all have to be refrigerated. I chronicle my food adventures on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bites_by_bren/">Instagram</a> and I love making homemade tortellini and sourdough bread. I deeply enjoy reading and am currently absorbing everything I can regarding agriculture policy in the United States. I have a Harry Potter tattoo and a missing finger.</p>


        <h3 class="lobster">Reach me.</h3>
        <p>Shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:brenna.sorkin@gmail.com">brenna.sorkin@gmail.com</a>, find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennasorkin" target="blank">LinkedIn</a>, or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bites_by_bren/" target="blank">slide into my DMs?</a> You can call me at 617.543.0996, but I will probably send you to voicemail, so I'd recommend email instead.</p>
