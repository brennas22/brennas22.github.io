				<h3 class="lobster-large">Hello again.</h3>
				<div class="small-spacing"></div>
				<p>Let me tell you a story. In December of 2013, partway through my junior year of high school, I accidentally chopped off a finger on my dominant hand and it set me on the career path I'm heading down now. I wasn't with my parents at the time and I went by myself in the ambulance to Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, where I had surgery in the ER. </p>
				<p>
				Over the next 18 months I had 3 more surgeries and spent 2 days a week trekking downtown for follow up care. I realized that even though I was lucky enough to have access to some of the best healthcare in the world, the <em>experience</em> in the healthcare industry was still extremely subpar.
				</p>
				<p>That, coupled with having to learn how to use my non-dominant hand, made me realize how much of a difference experience design could make in the fields of healthcare and accessibility. I'm most interested in long term patients who will always need to interact with the healthcare system and people with disabilities for whom assistive technologies can make everday tasks significantly easier. </p>

				<h3 class="lobster">Relevant stuff</h3>
				<div class="small-spacing"></div>
				<p>I'm currently a senior at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, where I built my major specifically to pursue a career in UX in healthcare. My courses have been a combination of design, computer science, and healthcare related electives.</p>
				<p> I make every effort to train myself as much as possible in my field; I have volunteered with the adaptive skating program at Franciscan Children's Hospital, done research with Northeastern's Wellness Technology Lab, and I spend as much time as possible reading about the coming innovations in healthcare.</p>
				<p><strong>Coursework:</strong> Interaction Design 1 & 2 | Experience Design | Fundamentals of Computer Science 1 & 2 | Object Oriented Programming | Product Design Methodology | Contemporary Issues in Healthcare | Calculus 1, 2 & 3 | 3D Design | Embedded Design for Robotics. </p>

				<h3 class="lobster">Irrelevant stuff</h3>
				<div class="small-spacing"></div>
				<p>Outside of work, I enjoy cliche activities such as traveling, cooking, and painting. I spent the summer of 2017 in South America (despite not speaking any Spanish). I got to explore Ecuador, Chile, Peru, and Argentina. Highlights were swimming with Sea Turtles in Galapagos and fainting at the summit of the Rainbow Mountain (17,000 ft!).</p>
				<p>As much as I love my career, my secret ambition is to open a bookstore-by-day, restaurant-by-night establishment where I can curl up in a cozy chair and read all day while somebody brings me snacks. I also have a cat named Atticus Finch who is aggressively trying to step on my keyboard as I type this.</p>
