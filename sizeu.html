		 		<h2>SizeU</h2>
		 		<h4 class="thin">SizeU is an in progress project I am working on as a part of Generate, Northeastern's Student-led Product Development Studio. SizeU is a student-venture that came to Generate for assistance in creating an MVP as part of launching their business. SizeU is a company focused on changing sizing in the fashion industry, specifically in online shopping.</h4>

		 		<h3 class="semi">The Problem</h3>
		 		<h4 class="thin">Create an electronic tape measure that makes it easy to take body measurements, BUT does not display any sort of number measurement to the user. Measurements from the device must be transfered to mobile and desktop where they will be used to help users sort through clothing items online, helping them discover which will be the best fit based on their body's dimensions (software is outside the scope of Generate at this time).
		 		</h4>
		 		<h3><strong class="semi">Key considerations:</strong></h3>
		 		<h4 class="thin">
		 		<strong class="semi">1. Margin of error</strong> - how will the user know the measurement is accurate if they can't see the number?<br>
				<strong class="semi">2. Method</strong> - how will the device measure?<br>
				<strong class="semi">3. Shape / size </strong> - how will the device feel in the hand? will it even be hand-held?<br>
				<strong class="semi">4. Communication</strong> - how will the device send measurements to desktop and mobile devices?</h4>

		 		<h2>Research</h2>
		 		<h4 class="thin">We began by researching existing electronic measuring tools. We generally found 2 categories:<br><br>
		 		<strong class="semi">1. Traditional</strong><br>
		 		+ Bagel: only existing measuring device with traditional string method and wheel mode, not requiring numbers displayed on tape, has 3 modes:<br>
		 		<strong class="semi-thin">1. String Mode:</strong> traditional unravel method with electronically stored measurements <br>
		 		<strong class="semi-thin">2. Wheel Mode:</strong> uses rotations of wheel to measure total length travelled <br>
		 		<strong class="semi-thin">3. Remote Mode:</strong> built in laser pointer, measures length to closest intersecting object<br>
		 		+ all modes transfer measurements to app through bluetooth technology
		 		<br><br>
		 		<strong class="semi">2. Laser Reflection</strong><br>
		 		+ Fluke 424D<br>
		 		+ Stanley Smart Measure Pro<br>
		 		+ eTape16 <br><br>
		 		We considered these options, but also tried to keep our minds open to thinking outside the box - maybe it doesn't have to resemble a tape measure at all!

		 		<h3>User Personas</h3>
		 		<h4 class="thin">The very first step in this project was, of course, identifying the user. As an exercise to begin thinking
		 		about the user, their needs, and what data they might need to keep track of, I created 3 user personas. <br>
		 		<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Persona 1: </strong>Attorney<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Fictional Name:</strong> Jane Smith <br> 
		 		<strong class="semi">Major Responsibilities:</strong> Works with disabled children and their families on IEPs and negotiations with schools<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Goals and Tasks:</strong> Keep track of client information, spends time researching policy in past cases, and contacting and conversing with parents, schools, and other attorneys. <br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Environment:</strong> Decently comfortable using the basic features of a computer and cell phone, but not beyond that. Works from home, mainly via Skype and email. Is responsive to emails, but struggles when technical issues arise.<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Things they might track: </strong>Payments, client information (address, phone number etc.), case status
		 		</h4>

		 		<div class="spacing"></div>
		 		<h4 class="thin"> 
		 		<strong class="semi">Persona 2: </strong>Art Student<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Fictional Name:</strong> Kyra Elliot <br> 
		 		<strong class="semi">Major Responsibilities:</strong> Studying fine art: interested in painting, drawing, photography, fashion, and printmaking
		 		<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Goals and Tasks:</strong> Research for projects, look for inspiration, post to her blog, shop for supplies, listen to music <br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Environment:</strong> Extremely comfortable with computers and most modern technologies. Is away at school running on slower wifi. Spends large chunks of time away from a computer working on art, but is always on her cell phone<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Things they might track: </strong>Inspirational posts, viewership on her blog, trending music
		 		</h4>

		 		<div class="spacing"></div>
		 		<h4 class="thin"> 
		 		<strong class="semi">Persona 3: </strong>High school senior<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Fictional Name:</strong> KT Brady <br> 
		 		<strong class="semi">Major Responsibilities:</strong> High school student applying to college, works as a lifeguard in the summer
		 		<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Goals and Tasks:</strong> Look at colleges, talk to friends on facebook, count instagram likes<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Environment:</strong> Extremely comfortable with all modern technologies and is up to date on current trends. Is always connected to her cell phone and responds in under 5 minutes<br>
		 		<strong class="semi">Things they might track: </strong>inspirational posts, viewership on her blog, trending music

		 		<h4 class="thin"> 
		 			Creating these personas I had to consider the wide variety of data that people from all different walks of life are likely
		 			to be tracking. I was very drawn to the third persona of a high school student looking for the right college
		 			due to my own experience as a transfer student. I wish that I had more organized information available to me during my
		 			college search process both times. It occured to me that this issue affects not only high school seniors and transfers, 
		 			but also potentially students applying to graduate school or Ph.D. programs as well. I did sketches for a search and information
		 			organization engine for both school and job searches because, while the criteria are different, the methodology is similar.

		 		idea was a job search board that would allow you to store documents, etc.. I was inspired by a combination of the job

		 		<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
		 		<h4 class="thin">This project was the first that I completed end to end, from problem identification all the way through a
		 		complete design. I learned a lot about interacting with users and the design thinking process as well as some technical skills such as Balsamiq, Adobe XD, InVision and user testing. I was also able to strengthen preexisting skills such as sketching and taking feedback in order to effectively iterate. If I were to change an aspect of my process or final product I would do more extensive user testing after my first round of visual design because I made a significant number of organizational changes.</h4>
