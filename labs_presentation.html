				<h3>The Problem:</h3>
				<p>Inconvenience related to husky cards: long waits to get into dorms, long waits at dining halls, losing your husky card</p>
				<h3>Our Solution: Wearable Husky Cards</h3>
				<h3>Types of RFID Systems:</h3>
				<p>3 types of RFID wristbands available: fabric with a hard plastic chip inside, vinyl wristbands with an RFID microchip, a rubber wristband with an RFID chip</p>
				<h3>3 types of RFID systems:</h3>
				<p>3 types of RFID wristbands available: Passive- No battery, utilizes radio energy from the reader (Current Husky Cards use passive RFID systems), Active- No reader necessary, contains an onboard battery, Battery-Assisted- Battery only powers in presence of a reader</p>
				<h3>Functionality:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Sender sends radio singal</li>
					<li>Tag antenna receives signal and powers chip</li>
					<li>Chip modifies signal</li>
					<li>Antenna sends radio signal back</li>
					<li>Receiver receives modified signal and extracts information from tag</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Potential Issues - Technical:</h3>
				<p>Size of chip, range and size of antenna, going into project without much background knowledge of RFID’s</p>
				<h3>Murata Chip - Model LXMS33HCNG-134:</h3>
				<p>3.2 mm square, 0.7 mm thick, Read Range: 15 mm, 1024 bits of memory, Operates at 13.56 MHz</p>
				<h3>Potential Issues - Logistical:</h3>
				<p>Must be: Small, Comfortable, Unobustrusive</p>
				<p>Other issues: Cost, Support from school,Manufacturing</p>
				<h3>Potential Issues - Adoption:</h3>
				<p>Safety: Is it valid identification?</p>
				<p>Merchants: Need to replace swipe terminals with RFID, Stores will need multiple terminals at all POS locations, Existing system may not support the RFID protocol</p>
				<h3>Future Plans:</h3>
				<p>Consult with people experienced with RFID technology (Professors, Engineers, etc.), Design and prototype a working wearable, Look into mass production/scaling the product to campus, Communicate with potential RFID manufacturers, Work with Northeastern University</p>
