	 					<h2>Problem</h2>
	 					<h4 class="thin">LiveData was looking to redesign a clunky and inefficient form used to collect patient information, schedule procedures, mark preop workup items, assign surgeons and more. Some of the main problems that needed to be addressed were: <br> <br>

	 						+ <strong>Organization of information</strong> <br>
	 						- How do people filling out the form quickly know what section information goes in?<br>
	 						- Can people scan the form and understand it?<br>
	 						- Is there a way to only complete the required sections?<br><br>
	 						+ <strong>Keyboard Navigation / 508 Compliance</strong>  <br>
	 						- Can the entire form be navigated in an intuitive way via keyboard only?<br>
	 						- Can a user who is colorblind, low vision, etc. understanding and interact with the form?<br><br>
	 						+ <strong>Error States</strong> <br>
	 						- How do users know that an error has been made? <br>
	 						- How do users know if an error has been corrected?<br>
	 						<br>

	 						+ <strong>Skills Utilized:</strong> <br>
	 						- Adobe XD <br>
	 						- User Testing <br>
	 						- Principle <br>
	 						- Design Research <br>
	 						- Wireframing

	 													1. Preop Workup items need to be distinguished from one another, need to be easily added/removed, need to be easily checked/unchecked <br>
	 													2. Other lists such as pharmacy items, special supplies etc. have additional secondary ifnromation that needs to be displayed. They also need to be easily distinguished, easily added/removed, and easily have their quantity adjusted <br><br>
	 													This was an ongoing design problem, which started before the implementation the entirely new form structure.<br><br></h4>

	 																My initial thought was to just enter each piece of data, one at a time, and they would appear as a line in the form. <br><br>
	 																This design was flawed though because there was no way of knowing what the next information you needed to know would be, and what if you didn't know a portion? How would you leave it blank and go to the next section? It is also very unclear which element has focus.</h4>

	 											If a user tries to move on to another section before correcting errors they will recieve a stronger indication at the top with a specific diagnosis of the error, as well as an indicator in the lefthand menu. <br><br>
	 											Something that had been discovered in the course of LiveData's development was that some users click save at the very beginning in order to see what fields are required and then only fill those in. The third image indicates this view - all sections with errors are indicated on the left and errors can be navigated one by one with the arrows at the top. <br><br>
	 											The same arrow metaphor applies when users are fixing errors. When an error is remedied the status bar turns green, provides a fix message, and the arrows can be used to navigate to the next error that requires fixing.</h4>

	 																				<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
	 																				<h4 class="thin">This was the first project I worked on at LiveData. I learned a lot about form structure and navigation efficiency as well as accessibility requirements such as color, contrast, size, and keyboard navigation. I also learned a lot about human behavior (aka users never do what you want them to) and how important visual cues are.</h4>
