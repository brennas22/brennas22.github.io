					<p>Elizabeth Stowell is a PhD candidate in the Personal Health Informatics program at Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science and Bouvé College of Health Sciences. I had the opportunity to work with her on an exer-game (exercise game) intended for caregivers of patients living with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
					<p>When I entered the project Lily had already done the research to show that caregivers often suffer from poor health outcomes due to the amount of time they spend caring for their loved one. She asked me to help with the visual and interaction design of the game, which was determined to have a gardening theme.</p>

						<p>I began by reading <a target="_blank" href="wellnesstechlab/lily/exercise_program.pdf">two</a> <a target="_blank" href="wellnesstechlab/lily/spaceship_launch.pdf">papers</a> Lily sent me to get acquainted with the material and findings of existing research.</p>
						<p>I then began exploring different types of games (not necessarily exergames, but many were in that realm) for inspiration. I mainly sought to find out how games encouraged activity if applicable and kept users engaged and coming back day after day.</p>
						<h4>Inspiration</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Spaceship Launch - From <a href="wellnesstechlab/lily/spaceship_launch.pdf" target="_blank">research paper</a> Lily sent me</li>
							<li>Non mobile games such as wii, dance dance revolution etc.
								<ul>
									<li>Include a hardware component</li>
								</ul></li>
							<li>Zombies, Run! - A mobile game where all you have to do is run, but the story is incredibly detailed in its scripting</li>
							<li>The Walk - The same developers as Zombies, Run!, but a different story.
								<ul>
									<li>unlock pieces / audio clips / content as you move</li>
								</ul></li>
							<li>Missile Wars - Real time, multiplayer game that uses gps to determine “blast radius” and you have to run to get out of the way</li>
							<li>Strava - Biking app
								<ul>
									<li>Good inspiration for leaderboards / beating your own records</li>
								</ul></li>
							<li>Charity miles - Philanthropy as a motivational tool</li>
							<li>Pokémon Go  - Additional benefit of getting people outside / forcing them to explore new places</li>
							<li>Wokamon: Monster Walk Quest - Keep a pet a live by walking (basically Webkinz for adults)</li>
							<li>Fitbit Daily Challenges</li>
							<li>Pact - Money as a motivator 
								<ul>
									<li>LOSE money if goals aren't met</li>
								</ul></li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Research</h4>
						<p>I then read a <strong>ton</strong> of research papers about different types of exergames</p>

						<p>My first iteration focused on selecting a plot to "plant" in and then selecting an item. My initial thought was to sort the plants by difficulty of exercise (e.g. a sunflower would take 60,000 steps to complete whereas a bluebell would only need 10,000.) I ultimately scrapped this idea though because I didn't want users to feel limited by the difficulty level or stressed by not being able to achieve goals.</p>

								<h4><strong>Coin System</strong></h4>
								<p>For the second iteration I switched from a difficulty-based selection to a coins system, wherein users receive coins for their activity level relative to their goals. We opted to make the coins relative to goals because with the time consuming nature of caretaking, setting a hard limit or requirement could pose too much of an impediment for some users.</p>
								<p>The seed shop was then converted to use coins, which would allow users to save up for a particular plant, making an item they desire accessible.</p>

								<p>Once the item has been placed it is "planted" and the plot turns green as well as displaying the image of the selected plant.</p>

								<h4><strong>Sunshine</strong></h4>
								<p>This week I switched gears and focused on the social aspect of the game. Lily emphasized the importance of interaction between users because caretakers tend to be isolated from their peers due to the time intensive nature of their care-taking duties.</p>
								<p>It was important to ensure that interactions between users would be positive and not provide any additional stress, either due to negative messages or due to the pressure of needing to respond.</p>
								<p>We decided to go with the motif of sunshine because it has a positive connotation and fits into the theme of gardening. This allows for a simple positive interaction between users.</p>

								<h4><strong>Team Plants</strong></h4>
								<p>We also decided to add the concept of a "team plant" that would allow users to come together and work towards a shared goal.</p>
								<p>A team plant has no cost, but is only added to each user's garden when all members of the team have completed their weekly goals.</p>
								<p>We chose to make completion relative to individual goals in order to avoid shaming any member of the team or placing unequal responsibility on anyone.</p>

								<p>It was important to Lily that there been a way to differentiate between exercise that consists of steps and stairs and exercise that is logged (e.g. strength exercises).</p>
								<p>I added the concept of watering the plants in the garden. Watering cans become available once a certain threshold has been reached (shown in blue above the navigation menu) and then they can be accessed in the seed shop and used.</p>

								<h4><strong>Exercise Log</strong></h4>
								<p>Since the age of users varies enormously and because many of them are likely to not be familiar with specific exercises it became a priority to make exploration an easy option. The exercises are broken into three categories for each navigation.</p>
								<p>Once a user has actually completed an exercise they will log it in the app. If they know the exact name of the exercise they can easily search for it, otherwise they can work their way down through the categories.</p>
