					<p>Elizabeth Stowell is a PhD candidate in the Personal Health Informatics program at Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science and Bouvé College of Health Sciences. I had the opportunity to work with her on an exer-game (exercise game) intended for caregivers of patients living with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
					<p>When I entered the project Lily had already done the research to show that caregivers often suffer from poor health outcomes due to the amount of time they spend caring for their loved one. She asked me to help with the visual and interaction design of the game, which was determined to have a gardening theme.</p>

						<p>I began by reading <a target="_blank" href="wellnesstechlab/lily/exercise_program.pdf">two</a> <a target="_blank" href="wellnesstechlab/lily/spaceship_launch.pdf">papers</a> Lily sent me to get acquainted with the material and findings of existing research.</p>
						<p>I then began exploring different types of games (not necessarily exergames, but many were in that realm) for inspiration. I mainly sought to find out how games encouraged activity if applicable and kept users engaged and coming back day after day.</p>
						<h4>Inspiration</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Spaceship Launch - From <a href="wellnesstechlab/lily/spaceship_launch.pdf" target="_blank">research paper</a> Lily sent me</li>
							<li>Non mobile games such as wii, dance dance revolution etc.
								<ul>
									<li>Include a hardware component</li>
								</ul></li>
							<li>Zombies, Run! - A mobile game where all you have to do is run, but the story is incredibly detailed in its scripting</li>
							<li>The Walk - The same developers as Zombies, Run!, but a different story.
								<ul>
									<li>unlock pieces / audio clips / content as you move</li>
								</ul></li>
							<li>Missile Wars - Real time, multiplayer game that uses gps to determine “blast radius” and you have to run to get out of the way</li>
							<li>Strava - Biking app
								<ul>
									<li>Good inspiration for leaderboards / beating your own records</li>
								</ul></li>
							<li>Charity miles - Philanthropy as a motivational tool</li>
							<li>Pokémon Go  - Additional benefit of getting people outside / forcing them to explore new places</li>
							<li>Wokamon: Monster Walk Quest - Keep a pet a live by walking (basically Webkinz for adults)</li>
							<li>Fitbit Daily Challenges</li>
							<li>Pact - Money as a motivator 
								<ul>
									<li>LOSE money if goals aren't met</li>
								</ul></li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Research</h4>
						<p>I then read a <strong>ton</strong> of research papers about different types of exergames</p>
