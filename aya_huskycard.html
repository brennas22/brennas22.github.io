				<h3>Study Trends: Snell Library</h3>
				<p>Usually when students walk into Snell, they walk around the entire length of the first floor, looking for a place to sit / a computer to use</p>
				<p>The chairs with the privacy are usually the first to go</p>
				<p>Often, there's only one or two people in a study room / Colab room, which is annoying if you're looking for a classroom with a study group</p>
				<p>Late at night, it's hard to find an open Snell Basement classroom if you're looking to study with a group, but often entire classrooms are populated by one or two people</p>
				<p>People get kicked out by others who've booked the room, but it's impossible to tell who's booked a room without going online.</p>
				<p>People often get stuck in lines waiting for the printer; people either have to print one page or entire packets, there's no way to streamline</p>
				<p>Maybe have an "express" lane for people people trying to look for printers</p>
				<p>Struggling to look for outlets / a study space with an oulet</p>
				<p>Add retractable extension cords</p>
