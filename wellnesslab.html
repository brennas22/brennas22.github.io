		 		<h2>Wellness Technology Lab</h2>
		 		<h4 class="thin">In Interaction Design, we were tasked with creating an interface for desktop and mobile that allows a user to keep track of some sort of data.<br><br>
		 		 A problem that struck very close to home for me, being a transfer student, was the college search process. While there are many websites that allow students to search by criteria, there isn't a way to save information from various sources all in one place; a student is considering not only the raw stats of the school, but also news, pictures and student testimonials all of which are found in many places on the web.</h4>
	
		 		<h4 class="thin">
		 			This video is a walkthrough of the desktop version of Clip.

		 		<h2>Features</h2>
		 		<h4 class="thin">Clip allows users to filter schools based on a number of criteria. Once they've found a school they're interested in they can create a collection centered around that school. Then, a plug-in (both mobile and desktop) allows them to save
		 		external content to the school's collection, which they can then go back to in Clip and organize however they choose.<br>
		 		<br>
		 		Recent trends in web technology have shown a large uptick and continued growth in the number of mobile users, especially when
		 		it comes to browsing content.  <br><br>
		 		In the mobile version of Clip the user can view their predetermined choices as well as see school matches, make and edit collections
		 		and, perhaps most importantly for mobile, add external items. The mobile version of Clip makes it extremely easy for users to save any content they come across directly to the relevant collection, where they can then view it on desktop as well.
		 		<br>
		 		<br>
		 			This video is a walkthrough of the mobile version of Clip.

		 			Creating these personas I had to consider the wide variety of data that people from all different walks of life are likely
		 			to be tracking. I was very drawn to the third persona of a high school student looking for the right college
		 			due to my own experience as a transfer student. I wish that I had more organized information available to me during my
		 			college search process both times. It occured to me that this issue affects not only high school seniors and transfers, 
		 			but also potentially students applying to graduate school or Ph.D. programs as well. I did sketches for a search and information
		 			organization engine for both school and job searches because, while the criteria are different, the methodology is similar.

		 		<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
		 		<h4 class="thin">This project was the first that I completed end to end, from problem identification all the way through a
		 		complete design. I learned a lot about interacting with users and the design thinking process as well as some technical skills such as Balsamiq, Adobe XD, InVision and user testing. I was also able to strengthen preexisting skills such as sketching and taking feedback in order to effectively iterate. If I were to change an aspect of my process or final product I would do more extensive user testing after my first round of visual design because I made a significant number of organizational changes.</h4>
